    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First I have to thank <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> for a great blogging framework and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> for providing this page!</p>

<p>&lsquo;So what is this blog about?&rsquo; you may ask. I will use this blog to show you game development with Java and OpenGL.<br/>
When you hear OpenGL and Java you will probably also hear about these two libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/">JOGL</a> is a part of JogAmp, which provides you with bindings to OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenAL and OpenMAX.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> stands for Lightweight Java Game Library and provides you also with bindings to OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL.</li>
</ul>


<p>So it is up to you which to use, they are both great libraries for high-performant computer graphics programming with Java. Personally I use the LWJGL for graphics programming.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a computer science student from Germany and in a few weeks I will start my bachelor&rsquo;s thesis about computer graphics.<br/>
During my course of studies I learned programming with Scheme, Java, C# and C++. Well I also learned PHP and JavaScript but that were merely the basics in my opinion.</p>

<p>In my free time I am a gamer and a programmer, or just lurking around in the Internet, for example you could find me on <a href="http://www.java-gaming.org/">JGO</a> which is a small community of Java game programmers, so if you like Java game development you should check it out!</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Soon I will start a tutorial for the new LWJGL3 in which I will show you how to use the that library to create a simple game! I&rsquo;m looking forward for it!</p>
