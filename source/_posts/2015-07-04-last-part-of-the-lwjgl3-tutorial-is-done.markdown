The final part of my LWJGL3 tutorial is done, this time it is about adding game logic and handling collision detection.  
You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki/Game-logic).

It is a pretty short tutorial, but for a more in-depth guide on collision detection there are some links at the bottom of the tutorial.  
The tutorial contains following contents:

* Updating Entity Position
  * Euler integration
* Checking for collision
  * Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)

I hope the tutorial helped you getting started with the new version of the Java Lightweight Game Library.  
And thanks for reading the tutorials.
