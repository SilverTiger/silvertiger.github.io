Finally the first official release of the Lightweight Java Game Library is done, with Version 3.0.0a there where a few changes.

One of the important changes are the type postfixes of some functions, it will break some older code, but it can be easily fixed.

So what comes next? It seems like LWJGL3 is going to get support for Gradle and a binding to AMD's Mantle, so that you can practice for the upcoming Vulkan API of Khronos because it is based on Mantle.

For more information on this release have a look at the [official blog post](http://blog.lwjgl.org/lwjgl-3-0a-released/).  
You can get the release version in the [download section of lwjgl.org](http://www.lwjgl.org/download) or [directly by clicking here](http://build.lwjgl.org/release/3.0.0a/lwjgl-3.0.0a.zip).

In the next few days I will update the tutorial for LWJGL3 and will upload the last part of it.
