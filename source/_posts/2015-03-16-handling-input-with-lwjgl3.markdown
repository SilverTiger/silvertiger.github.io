A new part of my LWJGL3 tutorial is done! It is long overdue because I had not much free time because of my thesis.  
But here comes the part for [handling input](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki/Input)!

In this part you will see the following contents:

* Processing events
* Keyboard input
  * Key input
  * Text input
  * Clipboard input and output
* Mouse input
  * Cursor modes
  * Button input
  * Cursor position
  * Cursor enter and leave events
  * Scroll input
  * Path dropping
  * Cursor objects
* Controller input
  * Button states
  * Axis states
  * Controlle name

The next part will presumably be the last one, and it will be about game logic like creating a simple AI and collision detection.
