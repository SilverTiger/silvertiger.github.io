It has been some time but a new part of my tutorial series is done! The new part of the tutorial is about [rendering with shaders](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki/Rendering)!  
For that tutorial OpenGL 3.2 core profile was used, but for the older computers there is also described how to do the rendering with OpenGL 2.1.

Like always the following list will show you what the tutorial contains.

* Creating an OpenGL context
* Vertex Array Objects
* Vertex Buffer Objects
* Shaders
  * Vertex shaders
  * Fragment shaders
* Shader Programs
* Rendering
  * Interpolation

That's all for this tutorial, in the next part we will take a look into textures and how to use them for text rendering.  
Until then stay tuned and happy rendering!
