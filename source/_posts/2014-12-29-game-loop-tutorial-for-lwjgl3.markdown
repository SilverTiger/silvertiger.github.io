The next part of the LWJGL3 Tutorial is done. This time it is about [game loops](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki/Game-loops) and contains a sub part for timing calculations.

The game loop tutorial as well as the timing sub tutorial will cover the following parts:

* Variable timestep loop
* Fixed timestep loop
* Getting the system time
* Calculating delta time
* FPS and UPS calculation

The next part of the tutorial will be about rendering with shaders.
