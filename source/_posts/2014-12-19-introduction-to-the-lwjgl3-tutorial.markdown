Finally the first part of the Lightweight Java Game Library 3 Tutorial is done! You can access it [here](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki/Introduction).  
In this part you get a quick overview about the creation of a simple application including how to setup your IDE.

The Introduction will cover the following parts:

* Setting up LWJGL3
* Initializing GLFW3 and callbacks
* Creating OpenGL context
* A simple update and rendering loop
* Ending an application

Feel free to comment the tutorial or write me a message for feedback.

For the next tutorial I plan to write about game loops.
